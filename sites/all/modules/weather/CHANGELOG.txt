---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Port weather 6.x-5.x to Drupal 7.x
* Split module into several smaller files. The file weather.module
  gets loaded and parsed on every page request, so having a small
  file size speeds up Drupal. The file has been reduced from 67 kB to
  21 kB, meaning a decrease of almost 70%. Moreover, the parser is
  now loaded only when needed instead of unconditionally on every page
  request, resulting in an overall size reduction from 87 kB to 21 kB,
  which is about 25% of the original size. This speeds up the weather
  module by factor 4!
* Implement a cache for parsed METAR data, so that the parsing needs
  to be done only once instead of every time the weather data is
  displayed.
* Rewrite download handler for METAR weather data. If the data is not
  available, the module retries at increasing time intervals up to
  one day to download the data. This better supports METAR stations
  which report their data only a few times a day. Moreover, if an
  ICAO code is no longer valid, the module tries to download only once
  a day. In both cases, the previous download interval had been
  10 minutes.
* AJAX code in location form is fixed. Closes: [#416892]
* Installation of weather ICAO data is about six times faster.
* The distance to the next weather station (for location enabled
  nodes) is now an explicit setting instead of being derived from the
  visibility setting. Closes: [#589222]
* A new display type has been added. This allows to show the weather
  nearby a user's location based on their IP address. This uses the
  data available from hostip.info.
* Replace file_directory_path() with file_default_scheme(). Thanks to
  John Voskuilen for the bug report. Closes: [#920508]
* Support a timeout for fetching new weather data. Closes: [#967646]
* Translation updates for:

  METAR reports. Closes: #128852

  and place lookup. Otherwise, the ICAO textfield will be shown
